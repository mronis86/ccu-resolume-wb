/**
    An off-screen buffer for one stage of the chain.

    Three things on top of the SDK's FFGLFBO.

    **It reallocates only when it has to.** Ensure() is called every frame and
    is a no-op in the overwhelming majority of them; it reallocates when the
    host's picture changes size. A reallocation clears, which is safe here
    because nothing on the GPU outlives a frame: the one buffer is the linear
    picture, rebuilt from the host's every frame (see `Ccu.h`). The only state
    across frames is the white-balance drift, and that is a CPU double.

    **It actually frees its colour texture.** `ffglex::FFGLFBO::Release()`
    deletes the framebuffer and the depth renderbuffer, then tests
    `depthBufferID` a second time where it plainly meant `colorTextureID` --
    so the colour texture is leaked on every release (SDK b1afaf9,
    `FFGLFBO.cpp`). `Destroy()` deletes it first.

    **It owns its filtering.** The linear buffer is read texel for texel with
    `texelFetch` -- the detail taps do their own lerp between two fetches at
    a fractional spacing, so nothing rests on a texture unit's filtering --
    and is therefore Nearest. Linear and Mipmapped are tinsel's and unused.

    Copied from tinsel (by way of clamp and toner), where it was written
    for a glow chain; the mechanism is unchanged.
